Given two integer arrays to represent Weights and Profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum
profit such that their total weight is not more than a given number ‘Capacity’. Each item can only be selected once.
Example:
Items: {A, B, C, D}
Weights: {2, 3, 1, 4}
Profits: {4, 5, 3, 7}
Capacity: 5
Output: 10 (when we will select C and D)


Note:
Do go through Dp_tabulation Soln before Dp_Most_efficient_soln
